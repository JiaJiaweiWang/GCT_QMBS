# GCT_QMBS
Code for calculations in the article 'Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems'. This file includes calculations of the evolution, eigen-spectrum, etc. for the one dimensional spin chains as described in the aforementioned manuscript. This file contains:

1. Python codes saved as '.py', where we have used the package 'qutip' in those calculations. 
2. Matlab codes.
   
We have named these codes in accordance with the figures from our manuscript. 
Ps. The code 'eigsub.m' diagonalizes Hamiltonian within a single symmetry sectors, and 'ptrace.m' perform partial trace over certain matrices.
