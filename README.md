# GCT_QMBS
Code for calculations in the article 'Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems'. In this file, we have calculated the evolution, eigen-spectrum, etc. for the one dimensional spin chains as described in our manuscript. This file contains:

1. Python codes saved as '.py', where we have used the package 'qutip' in those calculations. 
2. Matlab codes.
   
We have renamed these codes in accordance with the figures from our manuscript. The matlab function 'eigsub.m' diagonalizes Hamiltonian within a single symmetry sectors, and 'ptrace.m' perform partial trace over certain matrices.
