# GCT_QMBS
Code for calculations in the article 'Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems'.
Containing several Python codes saved as '.py', where we have used the package 'qutip' in those calculations. 
Also containing several codes from matlab. 
We have renamed these codes in accordance with the figures from our manuscript. 
The matlab function 'eigsub.m' diagnalizes Hamiltonian within a single symmetry sectors.
The matlab function 'ptrace.m' perform partial trace over certain matrices.
